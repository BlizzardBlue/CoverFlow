## How it works
CoverFlow uses [ColorThief](https://github.com/yamoridon/ColorThiefSwift) to find the dominant colors in the current playing song's album cover and creates color loops using these colors. The Phillips Hue smart lights then run these color loops. 

CoverFlow is only compatible with Apple Music.

## Installation
CoverFlow can be installed from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coverflow/id1537471277).
